# QR Codes Directory

Generated QR codes for ticket orders are stored here.

## Generating QR Codes

Run the artisan command to generate QR codes for all tickets:

```bash
php artisan qrcode:generate
```

To generate QR code for a specific order:

```bash
php artisan qrcode:generate --order-id=1
```

QR codes are automatically generated when tickets are created during the purchase process and are saved to this directory for GitHub version control.
